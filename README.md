# PM2.5 Air Quality Prediction

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for predicting PM2.5 air pollution
levels using machine learning techniques.

## Available Notebooks
- `1hour_prediction.ipynb` – Short-term (1 hour ahead) PM2.5 prediction  
- `24hour_prediction.ipynb` – 24-hour PM2.5 prediction
- `1 week_prediction.ipynb` - 1 week prediction and average of 2 weeks 
- `2week_prediction.ipynb` - 1 week prediction and average of that week
- `linear regression.ipynb` - 1 hour prediction by linear regression

## Project Objective
To analyze historical air quality data and forecast PM2.5 concentrations
for short-term air quality monitoring and planning.

## Dataset
A sample air quality dataset is included in the `data/` folder for reference.
The complete dataset was used during model development.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Highlight
The project demonstrates short-term and day-ahead PM2.5 forecasting using
historical air quality data in a clean, reproducible workflow.
